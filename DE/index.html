            <p class="secSubTag">Education is a systematic process through which a child or an adult acquires knowledge,
                experience, skill and sound attitude. It makes an individual civilized, refined, cultured and educated.
                For a civilized and socialized society, education is the only means. Its goal is to make an individual
                perfect.

            <p class="secSubTag">International education refers to a dynamic concept that involves a journey or movement
                of people, minds, or ideas across political and cultural frontiers.It is facilitated by the
                globalization phenomenon, which increasingly erases the constraints of geography on economic, social and
                cultural arrangements.The concept involves a broad range of learning, covering, for instance, formal
                education and informal learning (e.g. training, exchange programs, cross-cultural communication).It
                could also involve a reorientation of academic outlook such as the pursuit of "worldmindedness" as a
                goal so that a school or its academic focus is considered international.
